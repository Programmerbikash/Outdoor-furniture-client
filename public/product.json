        "description": "A desk is a piece of furniture where someone can sit and write, often with drawers or other places to put books, papers, and other things. Unlike a table, there is only one side of the desk where somebody could sit. Desks come in many different sizes. There is a Armoire desk, which is very big. There is also a portable desk which is very small. Desks can be used at home. They can also be used in an office. Desks may also be used in schools."

        "description": "A table is a piece of furniture with a flat top supported by one or more legs. We put things on a table, often for a short time, for example food and knives and forks, etc. at a meal, cups for drinks, a book, a map, writing paper when writing, and things for hobbies. We also put things on tables for a longer time, for example a TV, computer or decorations (pretty things). Often we put a cloth on the table, flat on the top."
